### What?
Analysing trends and semantics of published content in Hungary's leading online newspaper from 2014 to 2018.

### Why?
I wanted to prove with data that a once popular news outlet turned into political propaganda site.

### How?
I scraped origo's archive and stored all of their articles regarding domestic and foreign news.
Then I grouped and cleansed the data and looked at trends that readers noticed in the past few years.
